## EasyUI

A design system powered by React & Typescript, supported by Storybook & React-testing-library.

## Design Thinking Process

- `SCSS` is chosen as the styling solution for this UI library
- `normalize.css` is used to make browsers render all elements more consistently
- SCSS variables are defined for granular style control
- Typescript is used to provide strong typing to the UI library
- Unit tests are written with the help of `React Testing Library`
